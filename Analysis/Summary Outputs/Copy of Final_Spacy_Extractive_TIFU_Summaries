We love to discuss the show after I have caught up, so I was very excited as I made my way down the stairs one morning to talk about the episode I had watched the previous evening. I was so excited that when I came to the foyer, with my friend behind her desk facing me on the opposite side of the entrance hall, I could not help but start lumbering towards her, head cocked, arms writhing and outstretched, loudly snarling, moaning and groaning, doing the best zombie impression I could. I thought it would make my friend laugh, excite her for the upcoming zombie conversation, and also to try and distract her while she dealt with the lone customer who was stood with her back to me, talking to her. The hall was almost empty save the girl with her back to me. As I lurched ever nearer, I was confused as to why my friend was not smiling at my funny joke, but instead looking horrified and almost frozen with panic. It was too late before I realized why. Only two paces from the girl with her back to me, I continued with my brilliant impression, idiotically ignoring my friends grimace and instead increasing the vigor of my performance as I drew nearer.", "summary_text": ", head cocked, arms writhing and outstretched, loudly snarling, moaning and groaning, doing the best zombie impression I could.", "compression_ratio": 0.08813324080499653, "original_pos_tags": {"PRON": 29, "VERB": 41, "ADP": 35, "DET": 39, "NOUN": 46, "ADV": 26, "PUNCT": 27, "INTJ": 1, "ADJ": 18, "AUX": 12, "CCONJ": 9, "PART": 5, "SCONJ": 7, "NUM": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"PUNCT": 6, "NOUN": 6, "VERB": 6, "CCONJ": 2, "ADV": 1, "DET": 1, "ADJ": 1, "PRON": 1}}

They make wiping after a hefty shit a breeze, and I like to use them to give the old cock a good wipe after taking a piss. You know, for that extra minty freshness. It was 23:30.

The toilet still had some lingering blood creeping around even after several flushes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bleeding finally slowed enough for me to get a good look at the damage. I guess I was just too harsh with my cleaning, as that little line of skin on the underside of the head was bearing a sizeable tear.
