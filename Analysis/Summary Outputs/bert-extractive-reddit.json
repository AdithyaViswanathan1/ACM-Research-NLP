{"original_text": "this actually happened a couple of years ago. i grew up in germany where i went to a german secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). my school was named after anne frank and we had a club that i was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about anne franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, hitler, the third reich and that whole spiel. basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. \n\nthis was my last year at school and i already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. i was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. we start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about anne frank and the third reich? you'd be surprised how much they know. anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. after the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. one group watches a short movie about anne frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. then the groups switch. \n\ni'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and i take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. i'm going down the list when i come to the name sandra (name changed). a kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in germany, pipes up. \n\nnow keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). this being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for german standards) bavaria, i was confused. i looked down at the list again making sure i had read the name right. look back up at the kid. \n\nme: \"you're sandra?\"\n\nkid: \"yep.\"\n\nme: \"oh, sorry. *thinking the kid must be from somewhere where sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* where are you from? i've only ever heard that as a girl's name before.\"\n\nthe class starts laughing. sandra gets really quiet. \"i am a girl...\" she says. some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met sandra. i feel so sorry and stupid. i get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. we watch the movie in silence. after the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place i apologised to sandra. i felt so incredibly terrible, i still do to this day. throughout the rest of the day i heard lots of whispers about sandra. i tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip i had set in motion.\n\nsandra, if you're out there, i am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. i hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. i'm sorry if i made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. i'm sorry i probably made that day hell for you. i'm sorry for my ignorance.\n\n ", "original_pos_tags": {"DET": 83, "ADV": 50, "VERB": 86, "NOUN": 114, "ADP": 67, "PUNCT": 87, "PRON": 70, "PROPN": 23, "ADJ": 54, "AUX": 45, "NUM": 6, "CCONJ": 22, "PART": 17, "SPACE": 9, "SCONJ": 11, "INTJ": 3}, "summary_text": "my school was named after anne frank and we had a club that i was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about anne franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, hitler, the third reich and that whole spiel. i was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. you'd be surprised how much they know.", "summary_pos_tags": {"DET": 9, "NOUN": 9, "AUX": 7, "VERB": 7, "ADP": 8, "PROPN": 6, "CCONJ": 4, "PRON": 7, "ADV": 4, "ADJ": 11, "PUNCT": 9, "NUM": 2}, "compression_ratio": 0.11287758346581876, "tldr": " confuse a 5th grade girl for a boy in front of half of her class. kids are mean. sorry sandra.**"}
{"original_text": "it was last october, but i'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today.  \n\nafter my mom died from cancer last year, i started looking for my estranged father.  i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.  i never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so i didn't push her for information about him.  i figured he didn't care about us.\n\ni had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and i didn't have an address with which to search.  after her death, i felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that i have a beautiful little girl.  it felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us.\ni googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic.  i called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since i'd already experienced that several times while looking for him.  it wasn't.\n\ni had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic.  he told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable.  he said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that!  my mom was the best woman i've ever known).\n\nso, we started talking and skyping.  we spent a lot of time learning about each other. knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but i tried to believe that people can change for the better.  \n\nhe was exactly everything i needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving.  eventually, i told him that i loved him after months of talking with him.  he was over-the-moon.\n\nfast-forward to actually meeting him in person.  this is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that i sound like an ass.  i say this because i don't have a precise reason or event that i can point to as to why i don't trust him.  why he actually makes me really nervous.\n\nmy dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time.  he doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled.  he doesn't give personal space and, when i spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while i was sleeping.  he said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but i really felt uncomfortable with it.  i couldn't sleep and was so glad that i didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first.\n\nhe also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does.  i said \"no\" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued.  it wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl.  \ni've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips.  i have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype.  \n\nduring the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could.  i was so grateful for it that i kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me.  he actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if i cited my daughter and husband as reasons that i needed to chill with the phone.  he never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life.  he also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once.  \n\nagain, i know people can change, but at this point, i find myself wanting less contact with him.  the idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns.  i don't want to hurt him, but i just can't trust him.  i don't even know if i'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone.\n\nthank you for reading and i sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very happy father's day!\n\neta:   \n\n", "original_pos_tags": {"PRON": 140, "AUX": 58, "ADJ": 55, "PROPN": 2, "PUNCT": 85, "CCONJ": 41, "VERB": 137, "DET": 76, "NOUN": 104, "ADP": 70, "SPACE": 46, "ADV": 60, "NUM": 3, "SCONJ": 31, "PART": 31, "INTJ": 1}, "summary_text": "he was exactly everything i needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving. i figured he didn't care about us. i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.", "summary_pos_tags": {"PRON": 9, "AUX": 4, "ADV": 4, "VERB": 6, "ADP": 3, "DET": 4, "NOUN": 4, "ADJ": 6, "PUNCT": 7, "SPACE": 1, "PART": 1, "NUM": 1, "CCONJ": 1, "SCONJ": 1}, "compression_ratio": 0.054187192118226604, "tldr": "  i found my estranged dad, thought i loved him after getting to know him, got to know him better and changed my mind."}

{"original_text": "this is going to start like most of these with a \"this wasn't today but whatever\". just shut up, y'all want to here a good story. so, me and my two best mates are out in zante. first ever lads holiday. if you've seen the inbetweeners film, that was roughly our expectations. and it delivered. \n\nso i had never been sick from alcohol until the first night. zante changed that. apologies to megan, our rep, who received the blessing of my first ever tactical chunder. that's what you get when we arrive at 8:00 and we have dropped the bags and in a huge group on the way to the strip at 8:02. so yeah, shit had gone down, one mate nailed the grimmest effort of a girl in our whole resort and we carried on. \n\nfast forward to the third night, this is where i really fucked up. we waited fairly late to go out, plenty of predrinks, best digs on and ready for whatever the fuck that night would bring us. so we went slightly mad, laughing gas, headfuckers and erect nipples went down and down for a while. we followed the reps group and ended up in a bar/ club thing. at this point i was on the verge between loving it and cresting the peak. my confidence was huge, my banter and charm (i thought) was top notch and was chatting up some skirt. then my boys came over and told me that they entered my fucked ass in one of the drinking games. and, in case you have never been on this type of holiday before, that's code for torture involving alcohol. \n\nso it's me versus this girl, and i'm genuinely struggling to comprehend the instructions from the rep over the huge pa system in the club, but there is a load of drinks on a tray to the side and a barstool in front of me. that's what a state i was already.  i knew this was bad. so the idea was (from my memory), shot of vodka 10 spins around the bar stool, 10 push ups, 10 star jumps and there was 4 shots. then the same thing but with a pint (!) of sex on the beach. shit son. did this in a completely retarded fashion, then we had to find 10 members of the opposite sex to kiss and run back. done. some of the girls even volunteered, but most, i sort of just grabbed their face. then another shot of vod and one last excersize round. whoah nelly. \n\nas we got to the final big club where a dj was playing, i was totally hating it. felt just awful, could not control myself and i wanted out of this drunken stupor. my buddies paid for me to go to the vip lounge so i could sit down. sat down for maybe one or two minutes. could not handle it. the music, the room spin, jesus this is awful. ran outside. projectile paint job on a car parked outside the club. sat on the curb and vomited some more all over myself and the car. passed out. loads of people tyres to wake me up, apparently. would not move. i went to a place then that i never want to go to again. if i had a gun, i would have shot myself immediately. and i'm very much not suicidal. i wanted out. i wanted to die if it stopped my being this goddamn drunk. wanted to cry. saw an ambulance pulling up. got in. \n\nwoke up in the middle of the night on a drip, doctors and nurses standing around me. was on a drip. went back to sleep just to get out of this nightmare. i could not face reality. \n\nwoke up the next morning, no headache and far more sober, still with the drip attached. found my way to the hospital toilet, trailing the drip behind. found something else down there too (reset the counter everyone). yup. had done that overnight at some point. at this point i was just greatfull to be alive and not drunk. \n\nto shorten this part up, i chatted to the nurses and they basically said i owed about \u20ac500. as luck would have it i paid for travel insurance and the nurses said that we would agree to say i just had a stomach bug from the water, otherwise if there is alcohol involved they won't pay.  \n\nthis ended with me banging on the door of my bros hotel room. tears of joy in their eyes, all i could say was, \"i need travel insurance, hotel documents and out flight ticket home\". those words are now legend amongst us. \n\nthat's my tale. sorry if i wrote it like shit of if it was boring. it was one of the worst moments of my life, no actually the worst (i have had a lucky life so far in terms of relatives passing etc). and if someone can get a laugh out of it and/or learn from it, then it wasn't such a waste
